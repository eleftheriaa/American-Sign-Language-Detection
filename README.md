# Sign Language MNIST Classification

This project was developed for Project 1 of the Machine Learning course at the University of Aveiro (DETI).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning techniques to a supervised classification problem using the Sign Language MNIST dataset:

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist/data

The dataset consists of 28×28 grayscale images representing American Sign Language (ASL) hand gestures.

## Objective

The task is to classify 24 ASL hand-sign gestures (letters A–Y, excluding J and Z) using image data.

## Models Used

The project explores two different machine learning approaches:

1. **Logistic Regression (baseline model)**  
   Simple linear classifier.

2. **Neural Network (MLP with one hidden layer)**  
   Nonlinear model capable of learning more complex patterns.
